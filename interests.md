## Programming

Last year, my macbook broke which is one of the best and worst thing ever happened to me. Worst is obvious, best is becuase I had to switch to linux. I began using terminal more and more, switced to neovim and have became obsessed with the way of unix.

I am considering to do some system programming with zig, because, I guess it is similar to typescript and I've 3 years of experience in typescript. I had tried Rust, did not stick with it much.

## Maths

Math is prerequisite to so many techinal stuff, and I do not want any obstrcution in my desire to learn. If tomorrow I want to get into any technical area I should be able to immediately understand at least 40% of it. I had began to learn on my own through textbooks and youtube lectures, writing a lot of notes. Realized after 6-8 month, math is like boxing, it requires training. I can't read books or listen to lecture on techniques and would be able to utilize those in the ring. Same goes for maths, I need training in order to use the skills. At first I used Anki for practicing maths, Anki has it flaws, I began building my own solution, did if for [two month](./writing/2024-in-review) and quit. Now I'm using [MathAcademy](mathacademy.com) and it's great. 

## Sketching

This would be my first ever interest as I remember. As a kid I remember every saturaday(this is when I might be 5-6yo), in my school a teaches used to teach us some drawing, like umbrella, house. I used to love that, coming home I used to draw on paper or floor with chalk.


## Films

I like watching good films.
