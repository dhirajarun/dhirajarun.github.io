I played quite a few video games this year. Why don't I try to remember the first games I ever played, i thing it would be snake games in Nokia Phone. Those phone had snake game, cricket games and sudoku games. When smartphone were becoming the thing, there were games like Temple Run, Subway Surfers, Candy Crush. I used to borrow others' phone as a kid to play them.

On my uncle's computer, I first saw a cut scene of a game; later I learned it was GTA game. I don't know whether it was GTA IV or GTA Vice city. The protagonist has been captured by the cops and he with his partner are being taken somewhere in a van. Suddenly somehow van crashed and now the player has the control over the character. Man! as a kid I was intrigued, and that formed a memory leading to me searching for the game when I got myself a computer. I somehow found it. I would have played GTA IV for a while, completed couple of missions, killed bunch of NPC, ran through vice city to escape from cops.

How can I forget about PUBG mobile, I played it for more than a year regularly. I was in 9th grad then, people were crazy about it here in India. You are on an island with 99 other real players; loot, kill and survive your way till the end to get something called Chicken Dinner -- used to love the phrase 'Winner Winner Chicken Dinner'. I was an average player, trying to improve but sooner I accepted my faith that I am not made for it. Before the 10th grade I stopped played it altogether.

From then on, I rarely thought about playing video games. Until 2024, I was clueless about all sort of games which exist. I learned, this art form has a lot to offer other than BattleRoyale games. 

When I played 'A short hike', I lived a story, experienced a journey, had some beautiful conversations along the way. Someone taught me to fly, a coach taught me to climb. It was amazing how everything was related in there. I wanted it to be longer than 3 hours.

12 Hours, a game where everything happens within a house. Has just 3 primary character and 1 secondary character. You are in a house, exit the house or die and everything will start over, yeah you are in a time loop and too escape it you'll need to be alive till the end, and find all your answers. You can do this by utilizing everything you've got in the house. After this game, I wanted myself to build a game, something similar with little source all by myself I could tell the story within a house, with just 2-3 characters.

The Forest

Sekiro, considered as one of the hardest game ever made. Well, it gets its when you understand the mechanism. Initially it will be touch to kill the normal enemies, killing the tutorial boss was actually frustrating for me. But when with persistence I somehow learned the tech-tics before the first boss, I loved it, anyway it gets easier with every tries. You are a Sinobi who has a sword in one hand and a few prosthetics tools in another. Attack, defend and most important deflect; use your prosthetics tools as required to protect your guardian angel. Beating this game may require a lot of help, check out [FightinCowboy](https://www.youtube.com/@FightinCowboy) on youtube he will be your guide through out the journey in the game.

EldenRing, another FromSoft game but not as hard as sekiro, 

Red Dead Redemption
