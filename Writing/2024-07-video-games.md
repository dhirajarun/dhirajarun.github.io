I played quite a few video games this year. Why don't I try to remember the first games I ever played, i thing it would be snake games in Nokia Phone. Those phone had snake game, cricket games and sudoku games. When smartphone were becoming the thing, there were games like Temple Run, Subway Surfers, Candy Crush. I used to borrow others' phone as a kid to play them. 

On my uncle's computer, I first saw a cut scene of a game; later I learned it was GTA game. I don't know whether it was GTA IV or GTA Vice city. The protagonist has been captured by the cops and he with his partner are being taken somewhere in a van. Suddenly somehow van crashed and now the player has the control over the character. Man! as a kid I was intrigued, and that formed a memory leading to me searching for the game when I got myself a computer. I somehow found it. I would have played GTA IV for a while, completed couple of missions, killed bunch of NPC, ran through vice city to escape from cops. 

How can I forgot about PUBG mobile, I played it for more than a year regularly. People were crazy about the game here in India. At one time I wanted to be a professional player. It was made to be addictive. 

I was clueless about all sort of games which exist and I never experience those games. 

It was this year, this art form has a lot to offer than PUBG. 

When I played 'A short hike', I lived a story, experienced a journey, had some beautiful conversations along the way. Someone taught me to fly, a coach taught me to climb. It was amazing how everything was related in there. I wanted it to be longer than 3 hours. 

12 Hours, a game where everything happens within a house. Has just 3 primary character and 1 secondary character. Completing this and I wanted myself to build a game, something similar with little source all by myself I could tell the story within a house, with just 2-3 characters.
