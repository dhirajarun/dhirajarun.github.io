Yesterday, I was searching on reddit how to be a better writer and found a [blogpost](https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/want-to-become-a-better-writer-copy-the-work-of-others/) recommended by a random redditor. It introduced to me something called copywork. It is about deliberately practicing, by reading few sentences from a book you like and then write from your memory and comparing to see where you made the mistakes. There are many variants of copy work used to be practiced by some great writers from which I could only recognize Ben Franklin's name. I found the method interesting. I will try after publishing this blog. Whom work should I try this method on. i love the book 'to kill a mocking bird', will try on it for sure. I would try on couple of bloggers like Jason Fried (may be on his books too) or DHH and [Alex Kondov's](https://alexkondov.com/) blog. There's an Indian writer Ruskin Bond, I love his book 'Blue Umbrella'. It is so simple, beautify and it is novella, I would love to learn how he structure his sentences. His books are adored by kids and teenagers the most I think.

I was thinking about adding comments to my site. I will use github discussion for that, there a project I'll have to find out which will let me instantly integrate it. This way the content, the discussion everything will be on github. It may outlive me, I don't know as long Microsoft don't go bankrupt. I have this domain dhrjarun.com which cost couple of bucks each year. For backup I will as well have dhrjarun.github.io, in case I won't be able to pay for the domain.
