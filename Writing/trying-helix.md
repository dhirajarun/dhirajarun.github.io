I was scrolling twitter, There was a [tweet](https://x.com/peach2k2/status/1921888383858544872), saying "neovim killer, no lsp config or plugins needed", So I searched for [it](https://helix-editor.com/).

Read its docs, watched a [video](https://youtu.be/HcuDmSb-JBU?si=MyqZrZZZ_wuympRk), installed and tried it. In fact I am writing this blog on Helix itself.

The problem with neovim, is its ovewhelming plugins, which makes things slow. In order to leave I needed to make sure, it is faster and has all the most used functionality from neovim. Reading the doc and wiki I figured, it has everything from nvim. Just one I did not see was [flash](https://github.com/folke/flash.nvim), I felt little disapponting after seaching for a while then, in the video, I found, it has similar functionality called "jump to two character label"(gw).

So for now, I am glad, I found this, I'll be using it, will see if it still makes me glad after a week or a month.
