Hi, I am Dhiraj(20yo, he/him), You can also call me Arun. I mostly code and when I get bored of it, I watch movies, sometimes I draw too(I love perspective drawing). As of now, I am building [Dredge](./projects/dredge) a typescript library to build typesafe REST api. Feel free to [contact](contact) me I'll be happy to chat.

I am trying to write regularly on this blog. 

Read more about me on my [about](./about) and [now](./now) pages.
