Hi, I am Dhiraj(20yo), You can also call me Arun. I mostly code and sometimes I draw too, I used to do perspective drawing but lately I've been mostly drawing portraits.

Read more about me on my [about](./about) and [now](./now) pages.

Here are some links, you might be interested in:
- [Uses](./uses)
- [Interests](./interests)

Disclaiment: Anything you read on this site, do not take it for granted. I change my mind very often. You might find typos and weird sentences, reason being most of my writing will be published from the first draft, this is to lower the friction and form the habit.
