Today I added CMS to my blog. It used to be quite resistive for me to write blog. For instance: I had to first open VS Code then open this blog project. Now comes the writing part, and what can I say about it. Presenting my thoughts in VS Code is hard. Those little monospace fonts are best for coding not for writing stream of thoughts. Now I've lessened the resistance to write, I hope I'll be writing regularly. 

It is TinaCMS, it took me couple of day to make things work with my astro site. I was going for self-hosting, banged my head for couple of days. But then today just an hour before, I checked TinaCMS cloud pricing and it had something for me -- the free version. It took me half an hour to integrate the CMS. 

Couple of weeks ago I visited Terence Tao blog and there I found most of the blogs are one or two paragraph. I thought may be I should do the same. So I'll be writing mostly small blogs and it will be raw. It won't be fancy, edited like some magzine columns. I am not a personal writer. I am gonna make a lot of mistakes and nobody is gonna read it anyway. 

This blog will be like my journal, I would write all sort of stuff, except the private stuff which will for my Diary.
