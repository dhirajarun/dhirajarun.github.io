## Work

I work part time as a fullstack engineer for a legal tech company from 8 in the morning to 1 PM. After that I work on my side projects for 1-2 hours depending on my mood.

## Secondary Works

In the morning, just after waking up, I draw for half an hour (sometimes less) but not more than half an hour. These days I sketch portraits, people from real life and from show, a few days ago I sketched Dwight, Jim, Michael from The Office show. I posted these on reddit, Dwight post went viral more than 500 up votes.


From 7 PM to 8:30, for few days I've been solving math problems.
