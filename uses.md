- Nvim for coding, tried helix for writing notes, blogs, and trivial text editing when needed, but now everything is done on nvim.
- zellij (terminal multiplexer), I tried tmux, liked it for a day, but started missing zellij, zellij session persists even after reboot(this I took for granted), I've become accustomed to alt + j,k,h,l to navigate panes.  

- Alacritty terminal, I had been using for months 
- Recently tried, ghostty, wezterm. wezterm seemed promising at first, I thought of using it's workspace but it is not easy and proficient as tmux or zellij. When ghostty was released, it was buggy on linux, so I did not give it much thought. When I tried again, it was much smoother. It has good defaults, has support for images, the configuration is much much simpler, Theme selector, `ctrl+,` to reload configuration and many more. I've been using ghosty splits and tabs instead of zellij, let's see if this will stay or I would go back to zellij. If it gets some sort of session management builtin then we won't need any multiplexers. I use `ctrl+shif+{h,j,k,l}`to navigate panes, `ctrl+alt+{h,l}` to navigate tabs. I am thinking of adding `alt+{h,j,k,l}` to navigate panes would be easier.   

- I use zsh shell, and [ohmyzsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) to manage it. The prompt is simple `[~/dhirajarun/world][main]$ ` I like it that way.

- LLM = I use these through api, instead of buying subscriptions. There's a [cli program](https://github.com/simonw/llm) create by [SimonWillson](https://simonwillison.net/). I used llm as search engine, sometimes to write the first draft of code, or to get forgotten snippet of code, to understand some obscure confusing docs. 
- I had used cursor for 4-5 months, right now I use supermaven for tab completion on nvim. If needed I might use vs code autopilot. I've been trying [aider](aider.chat), will see how it goes. 

- [miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) for reading rss, I also use it to subscribe to the youtube channels and follow tech subreddits. 

- [rainbow.io](https://raindrop.io/) to manage my bookmarks.
