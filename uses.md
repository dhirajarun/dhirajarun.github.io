- Nvim for coding, helix for writing notes, blogs, and trivial text editing when needed.
- zellij (terminal multiplexer), I tried tmux, liked it for a day, but started missing zellij, zellij session persists even after reboot(this I took for granted), I've become accustomed to alt + j,k,h,l to navigate panes.  
- Alacritty terminal, I am considering to switch, explored ghostty and wezterm, wezterm seems promising, I thought of using it's workspace but it is not easy and proficient as tmux or zellij.

- LLM = I use these through api, instead of buying subscriptions. There's a [cli program](https://github.com/simonw/llm) create by [SimonWillson](https://simonwillison.net/). I used llm as search engine, to write the first draft of code, to understand some obscure confusin docs. 
- I had used cursor for 4-5 months, right now I use supermaven for tab completion on nvim. If needed I might use vs code autopilot.
