More than a year ago, I deleted the YouTube app on my phone, I have been using it on Brave browser. Not because of ads, but because of Shorts. I hate them in all its form wheter it's tiktok, reels. 

You went to YouTube to search something or just randomly open the youtube page, all of sudden, you forgot everything and started watching short, you came to your senses after like half an hour. I thought, if I use youtube on browser, the friction make it hard to get mesmerized by the youtube shorts. But I failed, everytime I was opening the browser, I began watching shorts. I even tried to hide the browser app, once again failed because I sometimes do some research and mostly read blogs on phone. 

It is sad, you can't use extensions on chromium based browser on mobile, but Firefox does support extensions on mobile, so I added a [short blocker extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-recommended-videos/). Although I use firefox on computers, but on mobile I prefer chromium browsers because of group feature, I can open tabs in the group and switch between them by just pressing single button at the bottom, much faster. Extension did the work on computers, but once again I failed.  

I was just browsing the Brave settings, in there I find what was much needed. I'll tell you as well, in the Brave Setting go to `Brave Shield & privacy` scroll, scroll until you see `Content filtering`, yeah click on that, you'll need to scroll once again to find `YouTube Anti-Shorts` just press that switch and make it red. You are done, the evil short's tab will just disapper, you won't see it polluting your search result and from now on it will cease to hypnotize and steal your time.
